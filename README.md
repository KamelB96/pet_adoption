Welcome to our Pet Adoption Website. Here you will be able to post and adopt pets! 


<u><b><h2 align="center">About</h2></b></u>
Our page allows users to browse available pets and submit requests to have their pet to be adopted. The page was designed by a team of three students from NYU ThriveDx Software Development Program. This project is a basic fullstack project devleoped using technolgies such as React, Boostrap React, CSS, HTML, and Javascirpt. The page connects to a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize to send and receive data. Axios is used to handle API calls, and Express is used to handle server-side routing.

## Contribution


_Note_  
For this six day project, we worked very collaboratively as a team and have all put in an equal amount of contribution towards all the functionalities listed above. We approached the project with a strategy where each of us took control of the screen for two days while the other two team members provide their input. This strategy allowed us to work effectively and productivly towards this MVP. The emersive discussions we have and the team work lead us to successfully create this website within the six days. Each of our team members have also went equally above and beyond to modify, touch up, and worked on debugging outside of class time.
